# grape1plots
Plotting data from Grape V1 receivers. 
To begin, download the most recent dataset from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6622112.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6622111) and unzip it into the `data/` directory. You can then run the main notebook to produce plots.
