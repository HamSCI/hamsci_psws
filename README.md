In terminal, clone repository and install with `pip install .`.

To begin, download the most recent dataset from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6622112.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6622111) and unzip it into the `scripts/data/` directory. You can then run the Jupyter notebooks in the `scripts` directory to produce plots.
