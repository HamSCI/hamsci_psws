**TODO update badges for production environment**


Plotting data from Grape V1 receivers.

In terminal, clone repository and install with `pip install .`.

To begin, download the most recent dataset from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6622112.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6622111) and unzip it into the `scripts/data/` directory. You can then run the Jupyter notebooks in the `scripts` directory to produce plots. 


## Installation

hamsci_psws includes both a reusuable Python package (intended to be imported and reused by other projects) and a set of scripts and interactive notebooks using that package. How you should install hamsci_psws depends on how you intend to use it.

**If you want to run the interactive notebooks**, you should download this repository and install from it. **If you want to use the library in other projects**, you can either do that or just install the library from a package index.

### If you want to run the interactive notebooks

Make sure you have a recent Python version and Jupyter installed.

Clone this repository into a suitable location on your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/HamSCI/hamsci_psws`

`cd hamsci_psws`

`pip install .`

You should now be able to open and run the notebooks within `scripts/` using Jupyter.

### If you want to use the library in other projects

#### From the Python Package Index:

The hamsci_psws package is distributed on the Python Package Index: https://pypi.org/project/hamsci_psws/

`pip install hamsci_psws`

#### From the git repository:

Follow the same instructions as installing the interactive notebooks.

4. Build the package (from the root directory of the project).

`python -m build`

5. Upload to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

`python -m twine upload dist/*`

Enter `__token__` as the user name, and your token as the token, including the `pypi-` prefix.
